  This is the main entry point to the wordle module

  The algorithm to solve Wordle is

  (Turn these into sentences)
  First, green the greens
  Second, grey the greys
  Third, figure out the yellows
  The rest is grey
  And we are done

  (Summarise green the greens)
  Wordle consists on an answer as well as a guess. We convert those into lists that can be processed together
  "Green the greens" is a first pass of processing where we mark those characters of both lists that are the same
  as well as being in the same place (or index). In the "guess" list, we mark with the atom :green
  In the answer list, we mark the character as "processed" by replacing it with nil.


  (Step by step)
  * Split both strings into lists
  * Both lists are zipped together in order to process them
  * 2nd Check both lists against each other
